# Data Cleaning Mastery: SQL Project for Efficient Data Cleansing.
## Skills: Data Cleaning, MySQL,SQL.

## Description:
In this SQL project, I focused on data cleaning techniques. I downloaded a 
dataset from GitHub and imported it into an  MySQL Workbench. 

I followed a data cleaning checklist that included identifying errors, ensuring consistent units and 
meanings, handling missing values, removing duplicates, addressing outliers, and 
more. 

Using SQL queries, I standardized date formats, populated property 
address data, broke addresses into individual columns, and made necessary 
changes to fields like "Sold as Vacant." 

I also removed duplicates and unused 
columns. This project deepened my understanding of data cleaning and its 
importance in accurate analysis.



## Commands Used:
 - CLEANING DATA IN SQL QUERIES
 - STANDARDIZE DATE FORMAT
 - POPULATE PROPERTY ADDRESS DATA
 - BREAKING OUT ADDRESSES INTO INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS (ADDRESS, CITY, 
 STATE)
 - CHANGE Y AND N TO YES AND NO IN THE "SOLD AS VACANT" FIELD
 - REMOVE DUPLICATES
 - ORDER BY PropertyAddress
 - DELETE UNUSED COLUMNS

## Conclusion:
In the end, I gained a lot of experience in SQL. As a Data Analyst, I have to know about 
data cleaning. In this project, I learned more about data cleaning. Data cleaning is one 
of the important parts of analysis. By cleaning data at the start, we will save lots of time 
in the analyses and helps ensure that data is consistent so it can be analyzed accurately. 
While It's come to data cleaning everyone has different kinds of checklists. For me, I 
have my favorite checklist.
